Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.Relationships between classes and objects, how they are composed, and how they interact
- Focus on HOW OBJECTS ARE COMPOSED to form larger structures
- Deals with object relationships, inheritance, and composition
- Answers: "How do I combine objects and classes?"
- Example: Combining a coffee with milk and chocolate decorators

Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.Responsibilities of objects and how they collaborate to achieve a task.
- Focus on HOW OBJECTS INTERACT AND COMMUNICATE
- Deals with object collaboration, responsibility distribution, and algorithms
- Answers: "How do objects work together?"
- Example: How a news agency communicates updates to multiple observers
